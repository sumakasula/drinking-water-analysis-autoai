Improved Source of Drinking Water Analysis using IBM Watson AutoAI
Project Overview
Access to safe and improved drinking water remains a critical challenge in India, particularly in rural and underdeveloped regions. Despite ongoing initiatives aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), disparities persist across states and socio-economic groups.
This project analyzes data from the 78th Round of the Multiple Indicator Survey (MIS) to evaluate access to improved sources of drinking water across India. Using IBM Watson AutoAI, the project builds and evaluates machine learning models to uncover patterns, disparities, and key factors influencing water accessibility.
The insights derived from this analysis aim to support data-driven policymaking and contribute toward achieving equitable access to clean drinking water.

1.Problem Statement
The challenge is to assess the percentage of the population with access to improved drinking water sources in India and analyze disparities across regions and demographic groups. The project also explores related indicators to understand broader socio-economic patterns and generate actionable insights for sustainable development.
